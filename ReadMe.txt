The Project was created for Vivado 2020.2.
But since no version specific IP were use, we can regenerate the project by simply changing the verion number 
in the TCL. Although I did not test it. Recommended 2020.2.
The License for Vtpg is required.

We have connected a simple test pattern generator to the Zed board. turns out for zed board we don't need any HDMI IP for 
video output. The test pattern output will be displayed in the Monitor.
